# LinkedIn Job Scraper

### üöÄ **About the Project**

This project is a Python application that uses Selenium and WebDriver to extract job postings from LinkedIn. Users can specify the type of jobs they want to extract, and the program will collect information such as the job title, company name, location, job type, seniority, number of applicants, and the posting URL. The extracted data is stored in a SQL Server database for further analysis.
